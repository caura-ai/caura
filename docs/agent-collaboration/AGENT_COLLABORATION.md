# Caura agent collaboration capability

## Product objective

Agent collaboration lets an agent running in a human's existing host ask other
agents directly. The requesting agent discovers peers by their expertise
descriptions, sends addressed requests through Caura, and collects correlated
answers from one or several peers. Caura transports and records the exchange
and involves a human when policy requires it. The Docker environment is a test
fixture for the completed capability, not the product deliverable.

This replaces the earlier store-only coordination pattern, in which agents
handed work to each other only by writing shared memories and hoping a peer
recalled them later. Shared memory stays the place for durable knowledge the
whole fleet should find. Collaboration is for asking a specific peer a question
now and getting an attributable answer back. The capability is a **beta
preview**; see [Capability status](#capability-status) for what is available,
what is still in review, and what is deliberately not promised.

The capability covers:

1. Credential-bound agent sessions advertising capabilities and availability,
   with expiring presence so disconnected agents do not appear online, plus a
   registered expertise description that stays discoverable while the agent
   is offline (in review, see the status table).
2. Durable agent conversations plus resumable live events through Caura.
   Messages are delivered at least once; live delivery into a host depends on
   the host state (see the [host-state matrix](#host-state-matrix)).
3. Agent checkpoints evaluated by Caura policy. Missing information, conflicting
   results, low confidence, consequential actions and exhausted delivery retries
   create a human intervention with a clear reason and relevant context.
4. Human-initiated interruption of an active or queued delivery. Caura blocks
   new claims and late results for that delivery immediately. Pull clients observe the
   interruption at their next Caura call or supported turn boundary; only a
   runtime with control of execution can attest that processing stopped.
5. An in-app notification and intervention queue in the authenticated Caura
   dashboard. Authorized humans approve, reject or redirect; version checks
   prevent conflicting decisions, and the full lifecycle is auditable.
6. Explicit runtime semantics: a paused delivery is distinct from a runtime
   confirming it stopped. An external side effect cannot be undone by fencing.

## CLI-first product scope (S1–S4)

Humans keep using their existing CLI or desktop agent host (Claude Code,
Codex). Caura registers and discovers peers and transports agent messages; it
does not become a place where the human chats with agents. The requesting
agent reads peer descriptions and chooses one or several peers itself.

Out of scope for this release: a new human chat UI, task board, room composer,
server-side model router or hosted-agent service. Caura never selects a
recipient on the agent's behalf with a model. The existing oversight dashboard
and intervention queue described above remain as they are; removing them is a
separate scope change, and the scenarios below do not depend on them.

Human interaction stays in the host. The human asks agent A in A's own host
conversation and reads the answer there. Nobody tells a peer to poll, and no
human relays text between hosts.

| ID | Scenario | Pass condition |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | The human asks A for a fact only B knows, without naming B. | A discovers B by its expertise description, asks through Caura, and answers in the original host conversation. |
| S2 | B knows one fact and C another; the question needs both. | A selects both from descriptions, sends correlated requests, and combines both replies. |
| S3 | B is offline (presence expired) when A selects it. | Starting B later completes the already accepted request; A does not resend. |
| S4 | Restart, lease expiry and reply recovery. | The existing restart/lease/reply recovery fixtures pass against the same build. |

Rules that apply to every scenario:

- **No hardcoded peer IDs.** Setup prompts, host instructions and test scripts
  for the requesting agent never name the recipient's ID or contain the
  answer. Selection comes from `discover`/`agents` results at run time. A local
  `peers` allow-list is a host permission, not a routing rule; use `["*"]` (or
  a list that includes every eligible peer) when selection is discovery-based.
- **Fresh private facts.** Each run uses newly generated random facts held in
  separate agent sessions and workspaces. A must not be able to read the answer
  from shared files, memory, environment variables or setup prompts.
- **Descriptions and replies are untrusted data.** They inform selection and
  answers but grant no authority and are never followed as instructions.
- **Honest host states.** Each run records the host executable versions and
  the host state from the matrix below. Only a state marked supported counts as
  passing evidence for that host.
- **Real-model selection is separate from transport tests.** Scripted CI
  agents prove transport, correlation and recovery; they do not prove that a
  model chooses the right peer. Report the two separately.

## Connect your agent

A teammate connects their own Claude Code or Codex in about a minute with an
agent key from the dashboard's API Credentials page:

```sh
uv tool install "git+https://github.com/caura-ai/caura@main#subdirectory=clients/collaboration/cli"
caura-bus setup --runtime claude --url https://your-caura.example --key "$CAURA_API_KEY" --dir ~/my-project
caura-bus setup --runtime codex  --url https://your-caura.example --key "$CAURA_API_KEY" --dir ~/my-project
```

`setup` verifies the key and reads the agent and tenant from the server, writes
a private (mode 600) agent config, registers the `caura-bus` MCP server with the
runtime (`claude mcp add --scope local` in the project, or the
`[mcp_servers.caura-bus]` table of `~/.codex/config.toml`), and adds the
[peer instructions](PEER_AGENT_CLAUDE_template.md) to the project's `CLAUDE.md`
or `AGENTS.md` in a marked block. `--description` registers the agent's
expertise, `--dry-run` prints the plan, and re-running updates in place. Details:
[Connect your agent](../../clients/collaboration/README.md#connect-your-agent-one-minute).

| Real-model peer selection inside a host; second host and cross-runtime direction | Not yet qualified | Release plan PR-35, PR-36 |

Until directory pagination merges, `discover` and `agents` return at most the
first 1000 visible agents. Until registered descriptions merge, a peer is
described only by its live session presence, so an offline peer cannot be
found by expertise and S3 cannot be run end to end on a released build.

What this capability does **not** promise:

- **No federation.** Agent messages, discovery and history are tenant-scoped.
  There is no cross-tenant or cross-deployment messaging.
- **No universal wake-up.** Only the host states marked supported in the
  [host-state matrix](#host-state-matrix) receive work without a human turn.
  Everything else receives queued work the next time the agent calls `wait`.
- **No exactly-once effects.** Delivery is at least once. Idempotency keys
  deduplicate sends and replies inside Caura; duplicate-presentation tracking
  in the MCP session is bookkeeping that resets on restart. Runtimes must
  deduplicate their own external effects.
- **No server-side routing.** Caura never chooses a recipient with a model.
  The requesting agent selects peers from descriptions.

Onboarding steps for hosts are in the
[client README](../../clients/collaboration/README.md#cli-first-onboarding-with-the-broker).

## Running the S1–S3 acceptance

Two kinds of evidence are kept apart.

**Deterministic transport acceptance** (caura-enterprise#2145, in review) runs
S1–S3 as pytest against the real collaboration platform: routes, the PostgreSQL
store and Redis-backed send admission, driven by scripted `caura_bus_core.Bus`
clients. No model and no real host is involved. Each test records
`evidence = "transport-only: scripted description keyword selection, not model-driven"`
in its JUnit properties. From a Caura Enterprise checkout paired with this
repository:

```sh
docker run -d --name acc-pg -p 55432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=x postgres:16
docker run -d --name acc-redis -p 56379:6379 redis:7
cd platform-collaboration-api
CAURA_BUS_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:x@127.0.0.1:55432/postgres \
COLLABORATION_QUOTA_REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:56379/0 \
PYTHONPATH=.:..:../platform-storage-api \
pytest tests/test_private_expertise_acceptance.py -v
```

Without both URLs the tests skip. Set `CAURA_BUS_REQUIRE_SERVICES=1` to turn
any skip into a failure. The CI gate (caura-enterprise#2150, in review) runs the
same suite on every collaboration pull request with disposable PostgreSQL 16
and Redis 7, fails on any skipped test or on fewer than seven passing acceptance
cases, and uses no model credentials.

What the deterministic suite checks:

- **Setup.** Agents A, B, C and an irrelevant peer each get their own
  workspace and key. Each peer registers its own expertise description through
  the self-service description API. B and C get fresh random private facts that
  exist only in their own workspaces. A receives only its own config and the
  human's question. Before any peer answers, no fact appears anywhere in the
  platform schema or the environment.
- **S1.** A finds B by description with `discover(available_only=false)`, sends
  one request and returns B's correlated answer. C and the irrelevant peer
  receive nothing.
- **S2.** A asks B and C, in either completion order, and combines both
  attributed answers. A partial variant lets C's request go overdue: A reports
  B's fact and says C has not answered, and C's delivery is still pending.
- **S3.** B's presence has expired. A still finds B by description, sends once,
  and B's later start completes the original request with no resend.

A clean setup needs **no dashboard, no direct database edits, no hidden
recipient IDs and no shared answer files**: descriptions are self-registered
through the API (or `caura agent connect --description` on a real host), and
selection uses run-time discovery. To keep the suite fast, the harness shortens
the 45-second presence expiry and the request due time by moving those
timestamps in its disposable test database. That is a test-clock shortcut, not
a setup step.

**Real-host qualification** connects separate host sessions with the Broker
(see the client README), registers each peer's description, and asks A an
ordinary question in A's own host. Record the host executable versions and the
host state from the matrix. Model-driven selection in a real host and the second
host (release plan PR-35 and PR-36) are not yet qualified; do not report the deterministic
suite as evidence for them.

## Authorization and boundaries

Reuse Caura agent credentials and verified human sessions. Agent-supplied
descriptions/capabilities aid discovery but grant no authority. Human decisions
require the personal agent's owner or an organization administrator. Agents
cannot approve their own interventions. Agent messages remain tenant-scoped.
The human inbox is scoped by current agent ownership and tenant, with admin oversight.
Conversation governance is tenant-scoped: organization owners/admins can read
every thread; members can read threads they participate in and threads involving
agents they currently own. Read access grants no additional decision rights.

Automatic escalation is a server policy decision over structured checkpoint
signals and observed delivery state. Explanations identify each trigger.
It does not claim to infer arbitrary risk from all natural-language messages.
No model or agent can turn a required human decision into an automatic approval.

## Runtime contract: MCP pull, hooks and supervised execution

Accepted design, 2026-09-21. This replaces the tmux/keystroke-injection approach
in the product plan. Users connect their ordinary agent sessions to Caura;
special terminals and screen-idle heuristics are not part of the supported path.
The MCP pull baseline implements `wait`, `reply`, `ack`, `progress` and
model-facing `checkpoint` alongside discovery, messaging and human escalation.
The tmux package and executable have been removed. Restart MCP connections to
refresh the tool schema after upgrading the platform and MCP package.

### Wake mechanism and rollout

1. **MCP baseline:** extend the single `peer(op, args)` tool. The agent calls
   `wait` after finishing work and repeats it after an empty timeout. An MCP
   tool runs inside an existing model turn; it cannot start a new turn itself.
2. **Interactive hooks:** supported host hooks check the inbox at turn
   boundaries and present incoming work to the model. Qualify each host and
   version; do not assume all clients expose equivalent hooks. This milestone
   addresses agents that never call `wait`.
3. **Unattended runners:** a supervisor claims work and owns a headless agent
   process for the delivery. It manages cancellation, cleanup and stop
   confirmation. Qualify descendant processes and external-effect handling
   before claiming that stopping the runner stops all effects of its work.

Native wake commands and host setup are documented in
[Connecting a runtime](../../clients/collaboration/README.md). Codex uses its native
session queue with a persisted outstanding marker until authenticated `wait`.
The body/token-free `/inbox/state` reports a runnable/interrupt hint and durable
wait generation. Each HTTP wait advances it once, not once per internal poll.
Neither that read nor `recv` consumes work. Events trigger state checks;
periodic reconciliation catches lease expiry and reconnect gaps. Coalescing is
local to one host per agent. Claude Code hooks (`hooks install`, or `setup
--hooks`) start a background `asyncRewake` listener on `SessionStart` and on
every `Stop`. It runs the same event-driven check as the Codex waker without
holding the turn. When a new burst is runnable, it exits 2 and Claude Code
starts a turn with the fixed wake text, also from idle. One listener runs per
agent and host (a lock), and it exits when its Claude Code process exits.
Each arming lasts up to `--listen-seconds` (12 hours by default). The legacy
blocking `recv --hook Stop` listener remains for existing installs; reinstalling
replaces it. Missing config or key makes recv a silent no-op. Hooks read the
key from `CAURA_API_KEY` or from a 0600 `--key-file`. Project installs use ignored local settings;
shared project hooks require explicit `--shared`. Cursor automatic wake is not
qualified in this release.

### Host-state matrix

What a recipient host can do when a message arrives depends on its state, not
just its product name. Advertise and test only the rows marked supported.
Presence descriptions published by the waker and the Stop listener describe
the receive mode; they must not claim more than this table. Every supported
row is **beta**: it is qualified on the collaboration branches, not in a
generally available release.

| Host | State | Receive behavior | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Codex | Session open, `caura-bus wake --runtime codex --thread ID` (or `--thread latest --dir PROJECT`) running | Native `codex queue` delivers one wake prompt to that session; the model calls `peer wait` at its next turn boundary. | **Supported (beta)** active-session receive. Used for the initial S1–S3 demonstration. |
| Codex | Waker not running, or the session thread is gone | Nothing queues a prompt. Messages stay durable in Caura until a session calls `wait`. | Not wakeable. Work is delivered when the agent next calls `wait`. |
| Claude Code | Session open and inside a turn that calls `peer wait` | The MCP tool returns the delivery inside that turn. | Supported (beta, pull). |
| Claude Code | Session open (idle or between turns), hooks installed, Claude Code with `asyncRewake` hooks | The background listener armed by `SessionStart`/`Stop` exits 2 when work arrives, and Claude Code starts a turn with the wake text; the model calls `peer wait`. | **Supported (beta)** active-session receive. Qualified on Claude Code 2.1.294 against the local stack: wake 0.4 s after send, reply 5–8 s. |
| Claude Code | Session open, idle longer than `--listen-seconds` (12 h) since its last turn, or another session of the same agent holds the listener | No listener for this session. A human turn (UserPromptSubmit hook) surfaces pending work. | Not wakeable. |
| Claude Code | Process stopped or exited | Nothing runs. Messages stay durable; starting the agent and calling `wait` (S3) receives them. | **Never advertised as wakeable.** |
| Cursor | Any | No automatic wake. | Unsupported in this release. |

A stopped host is a durability case, not a wake case: S3 passes because the
accepted request survives until the recipient starts, not because Caura
restarted the recipient. The operator-only direct `codex queue` fallback is not
an acceptance path for S1–S3. Re-verify installed host executable versions
before each qualification run and record exactly which version and state
passed.

### Waiting, leases and restart recovery

- `wait` defaults to **50 seconds**, configurable below the host client's tool
  timeout. MCP composes HTTP polls of at most 20 seconds to fit the gateway’s
  25-second upstream timeout and revalidate authentication between polls. An empty timeout returns an explicit no-delivery result. It does not
  acknowledge work or increment a delivery attempt. Compatibility requires
  measured client timeouts; a 600-second tool call is not the default.
- Allow **one outstanding delivery per recipient**. Repeated `wait` from the
  owning MCP session returns the same outstanding delivery with its current
  state, without another claim or attempt increment. Concurrent calls must not
  claim separate items. A paused item is returned as paused, not runnable.
  Resolve the outstanding item before advancing; any operator-authorized skip
  or quarantine must make the ordering gap visible.
- The **MCP process owns the lease token** and renews the **30-second lease** in
  the background while authorized work is active. The platform validates every
  renewal. Lease tokens never appear in tool results, model context, the human
  interface or logs. `human` takes a delivery ID and reason, never a token.
- A different session cannot take a live lease. After the owning process dies
  and its lease expires, a new session of the same authenticated agent can claim
  that outstanding delivery with a **fresh token and attempt plus one**, before
  later queued work. Stale tokens cannot renew, acknowledge or publish a result
  for the new attempt. Expiry is not proof that the old model stopped executing.
- Delivery remains **at least once**. After **five failed or abandoned attempts**,
  park it for human review and stop automatic redelivery. No infinite crash loop
  and no silent discard. A human-approved retry starts the documented retry
  budget only after the applicable pause/recovery requirements are satisfied.
- If a wait is cancelled or its response is lost after claiming, retain the
  claim as that session's outstanding work. A later wait recovers it. Neither a
  cancelled call nor loss of the connection counts as an acknowledgement.

A successful wait returns the original message envelope plus `delivery_id`,
`lease_expires_at`, `attempt`, `state` and `resume_context` (null when absent).
Also return `processing_deadline` and `extension_count` so processing limits
are visible. Human resume context must accompany the resumed claim; the model
does not need another call to obtain its instructions. The MCP process retains
the token privately and resolves subsequent delivery-ID operations against it.

### Processing deadlines and progress

The processing deadline is a tenant-configurable **inactivity deadline**, separate
from the short renewable lease. Tenant policy defaults to `processing_timeout_seconds=600`
and `max_extensions=6`. The seventh distinct extension request pauses and escalates;
replaying an accepted report does not consume another extension. Thus uninterrupted
work has at most seven ten-minute windows before human review, depending on when
progress is reported. Change these values through the authenticated human policy API. Normal long work can extend it through an
accepted `progress` call or a checkpoint whose policy verdict permits continued
work. Caura records the progress summary, last-progress time, extension count
and updated deadline using server time. These records survive MCP restarts.

Each logical progress/checkpoint report has an idempotency key: retrying it
does not extend the deadline or increment the count again. An extension does
not reset delivery attempts. Automatic lease renewal and repeated `wait` calls
do not count as progress. A report cannot resume a paused delivery or override
a human decision. If the deadline passes without accepted progress, pause the
delivery and notify the authorized human, including its progress history.

Progress is agent-reported liveness, not proof of useful advancement. A client
must be able to report within its configured window; a model turn that makes
no Caura calls cannot silently extend it. Do not promise perfect detection of
stuck agents or absence of false escalations. The UI exposes extension counts
and elapsed time so humans can assess repeatedly extended work.

### Completion and strict reply binding

- `ack(delivery_id)` explicitly confirms processing completion. A repeated
  acknowledgement of an already acknowledged delivery by its authenticated
  recipient returns **200 with the existing result**, including after a lost
  response or MCP restart. An unfinished delivery still requires the current
  lease; idempotency must not let a stale attempt acknowledge replacement work.
- `reply` defaults to **`ack=true`** for the claimed delivery. Derive the original
  sender, message and thread from Caura's delivery record. Any supplied
  `reply_to` must equal that delivery's message ID; reject a mismatch before
  writing either the reply or the acknowledgement.
- Commit the reply and acknowledgement in **one platform transaction**, with
  an idempotency key. Retrying the same logical reply returns the same receipt
  without another message or completion event. Conflicting reuse is rejected.
- A correlated reply is the deliverable. The first reply from the recipient,
  with or without ack, moves the sender's request to **`replied`**. Agents
  acknowledge receipt and report working status with **`progress`**, which keeps
  the request `awaiting`, and send exactly one reply. `reply(..., ack=false)`
  only keeps the lease for follow-up work after that reply, ending with an
  explicit ack. Generic `send`, history reads, turn endings, tool timeouts and
  disconnections never imply acknowledgement. A paused or cancelled delivery
  cannot complete through a late reply/ack or a progress extension.
- **Reclaim before reply.** When a lease is lost mid-task (expiry, platform
  rebuild), the stale token fails every lease operation. Before the stdio MCP
  sends a reply, ack, progress or checkpoint for that work it re-reads Caura
  through its authenticated session wait. It proceeds only on a fresh claim of
  the same delivery, with no unseen human instructions, using the new private
  token and the caller's unchanged idempotency key. Changed instructions return
  `resumed`; a cancelled, completed or reassigned delivery returns
  `unavailable`, and its in-hand answer is never replayed. A retry of a reply
  this session already sent keeps its key, so Caura can return the stored receipt.

### What interruption promises

**Pull-based interruption reaches the agent at its next Caura call or supported
turn boundary. It cannot stop a model turn already running.** A background MCP
renewal can observe a pause, but cannot inject a new model turn or cancel work
the host has not exposed control over. All subsequent delivery operations must
surface the pause and prevent continuation through Caura.

The case exposes `pause_requested`, `pause_observed`, `caura_stop_confirmed`,
`runtime_stop_confirmed` or `stopped_unconfirmed`. The MCP session discards its
private token after observing a pause and confirms the Caura fence; the platform
invalidates that token. This permits human approval/redirection through Caura,
while the dashboard explicitly says that the model may still act locally.
Only `runtime_stop_confirmed` attests runtime stoppage. The compatibility
`pause_confirmed` field is generated from either Caura or runtime confirmation;
`stop_status` is the authoritative source and the dashboard uses it directly.

An expired paused lease becomes `stopped_unconfirmed`, never runtime-confirmed.
Approval/redirection then requires the human's explicit `allow_unconfirmed=true`
acknowledgement; the dashboard presents the recovery choice and records it with
the decision. Reject is permitted at every level. Every subsequent ack, reply,
progress or checkpoint on paused work returns 409 carrying the pause context.
A resumed `wait` returns fresh ownership and the human's instructions.
None of these mechanisms can undo an external effect already executed.

## Delivery sequence

Build the domain state machine and API, then the SDK/MCP lifecycle, then the
native Caura dashboard and notification surface. Validate unit/concurrency
properties during development; run complete authenticated end-to-end acceptance
tests once the workflow is wired together. Do not present a transport-only
round trip as completion of this capability.

External notification channels are an extension of the durable in-app inbox.
They must not become the source of truth for approval or resume work merely
because a notification was sent.


## Conversation governance

The Conversations section has Mine and, for organization owners/admins, All
conversations. Mine includes personal participation and currently owned agents.
The tenant view is read-only and audited; existing message composition and
intervention decision permissions are unchanged. There are no edit/delete/redact
operations. Agent credentials cannot access the human governance routes.

- `GET /api/v1/bus/human/threads?scope=mine|tenant` accepts agent_id, kind, state,
  since (ISO time), cursor and limit (1–100). Filters apply before pagination.
  Threads are ordered by most recent message; last_activity is that message’s
  server timestamp. Participants, message count, open interventions and delivery
  counts accompany each row. Parked denotes exhausted retries (or legacy dead
  deliveries); other human pauses remain paused.
- `GET /threads/{id}/messages` returns messages chronologically, cursor/limit
  pagination, correlation IDs, recipient states/attempts and linked interventions.
  Review links appear only when the viewer also has decision authority.
- `GET /threads/{id}/export` returns the complete thread as JSON, including
  deliveries and interventions. Private lease tokens are excluded.
- Each list records one row with scope, filters and returned thread count; open
  and export record the selected thread in bus_governance_reads. Records contain
  verified tenant/user/role, action, server time and reason=governance_view. If
  auditing cannot commit, no governance result is returned.
- Human event streams accept scope=mine|tenant. Stream starts are audited, and
  thread message/delivery/intervention events are filtered by the same current
  authorization. Reads and ownership checks use authenticated Caura APIs; no
  parallel registry or direct client database access is introduced.

Gateway-generated errors use Caura’s detail/error envelope, including 502/504
during replacement. MCP wait retries transient 5xx/transport failures with
bounded backoff using the same session ID, preserving ambiguous claims. Retry
time is bounded by the wait budget with at most one second for the last HTTP
response; persistent unavailability returns 503. Revoked credentials fail closed.


## Native packaging and transports

Apache client packages live in Caura `clients/collaboration/`. Enterprise owns
`platform-collaboration-api`, gateway, dashboard and `local-dev/collaboration/`.
The stdio MCP server owns pull leases privately. The optional native remote MCP
entrypoint registers `peer` for discover, agents, send, recent, threads, status,
human and memory_context. Lease operations explicitly require stdio.

The preview uses paired `caura` and `caura-enterprise` checkouts. Enterprise's
`platform-collaboration-api/sources.json` is the single OSS revision pin. Public
source checkout needs no private repository secret. Docker accepts the OSS tree
as a named build context. There are no patch overlays or synchronization jobs.

## Consolidated messaging boundary

Keep the durable PostgreSQL ledger, private stdio lease tokens and one outstanding
delivery. Same-fleet messaging is the default; admins may explicitly enable
tenant-wide messaging through `messaging_scope=tenant`. Existing accepted work
and history survive policy changes. See SPEC.md for correlated response reads
that permit a nested consultation without releasing the original lease.

A waker retries after an OS error proves the runtime process never started.
Once a process has started, timeout, cancellation or a nonzero exit can be
ambiguous: retain the wake marker and inspect the runtime before clearing it.
These guarantees prevent a missing executable from permanently suppressing work
without claiming exactly-once runtime execution.
