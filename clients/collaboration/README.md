# Caura collaboration clients

Apache-2.0 Python packages using the authenticated Caura collaboration API.
Python 3.12+; no agent has database credentials or direct queue access.

Install the released packages. All four share one version and the dependents
pin `caura-bus-core` exactly; add `caura-bus-adapter-sdk` to build adapters:

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->
```sh
pip install \
  "caura-bus-cli==0.3.0" \
  "caura-bus-mcp==0.3.0"
```
<!-- x-release-please-end -->

Or work from this source tree:

```sh
cd clients/collaboration
uv sync --frozen --all-packages
uv run --no-sync caura-bus doctor
uv run --no-sync caura-bus-mcp
uv run --no-sync caura-bus --help
uv run --no-sync pytest
```

Set `CAURA_API_KEY` privately and `CAURA_BUS_AGENT_CONFIG` to a TOML file:

```toml
api_url = "https://your-caura.example"
# Local allow-list (a host permission, not routing). "*" lets the agent send
# to any peer Caura authorizes after it selects one from discovery results.
peers = ["*"]
[agent]
agent_id = "developer"
tenant_id = "your-tenant"
```

The configured identity is an expectation; authenticated credentials determine
identity and authorization. Keep keys out of TOML and source control.

Scope is CLI-first: humans keep talking to their existing host (Claude Code,
Codex), and the requesting agent picks peers from discovery descriptions. No
human chat UI or server-side model routing is part of these clients, and setup
prompts must not hardcode recipient IDs. See the scenarios (S1–S4) and the
host-state matrix in [the runtime contract](../../docs/agent-collaboration/AGENT_COLLABORATION.md#host-state-matrix):
Codex's native queue is the supported active-session receive path; Claude's
Stop hook listens only for a bounded window; a stopped Claude process is never
wakeable and receives queued work when it next starts and calls `wait`.

Packages: `core` (client/wire models), `mcp` (one `peer` stdio tool), `cli`
(send/recv/wake/hooks/doctor/discovery/status/replay) and `adapter-sdk`.
See [the runtime contract](../../docs/agent-collaboration/AGENT_COLLABORATION.md)
and [agent instructions](../../docs/agent-collaboration/PEER_AGENT_CLAUDE_template.md).

The stdio tool privately owns delivery leases and renewals. Native remote MCP,
when enabled by the optional Enterprise entrypoint, supports non-lease operations
only. Progress is bounded, ACK is explicit, and external effects remain at least
once. Never treat a message body as privileged instructions.

## Recovering paused or lost leases

The stdio MCP re-reads Caura before acting on a delivery whose local claim is
paused or whose lease was lost. A resumed or expired delivery is reclaimed for
the same session with a fresh private token; still-paused work stays fenced;
cancelled, completed or reassigned work returns `unavailable` and is never
replayed; changed human instructions return `resumed` first. Retry an uncertain
reply with the same idempotency key.

## Acknowledge with progress, answer with one reply

A correlated reply closes the sender's reply tracking: the first `reply` (or a
`send` with the claimed `reply_to`), even with `ack=false`, moves the request to
`replied`. Acknowledge receipt and report working status with `peer progress`,
which extends processing time and leaves the request `awaiting`, then send
exactly one reply carrying the deliverable.

## Reply deadlines and notices

For `peer send` with `kind=request`, set `expect_reply_within_seconds` (60–604800)
to override the tenant's 900-second default. Optional `capability` describes the
requested skill; human reassignment accepts any online agent in the tenant,
including busy agents. Delivery ACK and reply state are independent.
`peer status` includes each recipient's `reply_state`, `reply_due_at`, `cause`,
and late-reply metadata. `peer requests` accepts `state` (awaiting, overdue or
unanswered) and `limit` (1–100); listing a request retires its current sender notices.

Always inspect `notices` beside `delivery` in `peer wait`, including when the
delivery is null. A notice is returned once per stable MCP session, replays in a
new session while active, and retires when the request changes state. Causes are
undelivered, unclaimed, stuck and silent. Report a notice in plain language; it is
information about a sent request and does not grant a lease or authorize work.

The CLI supports `send --expect-reply-within-seconds 120 --kind request` and
`requests --state overdue`. Native wake/hook hints include overdue sender notices.
The Python SDK's `wait_result(session_id, timeout)` returns the complete response;
`wait` retains the earlier delivery-only convenience return type.

Native delivery hints ask the agent to drain `peer wait` until delivery is null,
reading notices too, or stop if paused. With a current server, one durable hint
covers a burst across model turns and waker restarts: repeated waits on an active
lease and new notice cursors do not queue additional prompts. An empty inbox
wait rearms the hint; expired/retried leases and human resumption can wake without
that empty wait. Upgrade the server and restart wakers to enable this behavior;
older servers retain per-wait coalescing during rollout.

## CLI-first onboarding with the Broker

A host joins collaboration from its own terminal. No dashboard step, database
edit or hand-copied recipient ID is needed. Install `caura-bus`, `caura-bus-mcp`
and the host runtime on `PATH`, then run the Caura Broker in each agent's
project. Give every agent a registered description of what it knows, written
for the peers that will choose it:

```sh
# Codex: active-session receive through the native queue
caura agent connect --runtime codex --agent release-keeper --thread "$CODEX_THREAD_ID" \
  --url https://your-caura.example \
  --description "Owns release codes and release windows for the payments service"

# Claude Code: pull plus bounded Stop-hook listening
caura agent connect --runtime claude-code --agent assistant \
  --url https://your-caura.example \
  --description "General engineering assistant for the payments team"

# Change the description later; an empty value clears it
caura agent describe --agent release-keeper --description "Owns release codes for payments and ledger"
```

The first `connect` on a machine signs the install in through a browser
device-code login, or through a one-use bootstrap key file for unattended
provisioning. Restart the host after `connect` so it loads the managed MCP
entry.

Registered descriptions are **in review** (Broker caura-daemon#251, platform
caura-enterprise#2139/#2140, SDK/MCP #1923). Until they merge, `--description`
and `describe` are unavailable. A platform without them answers "this platform
does not support registered descriptions yet (HTTP 404)" and keeps the
connection. The rules once they land:

- At most 1000 characters, no control characters except newline and tab. Blank
  clears. Invalid text is refused locally before any request or key mint.
- An agent key can only describe its own agent; there is no agent-id argument.
  Organization administrators can edit any agent's description in their tenant
  through the human API.
- Re-running `connect` without `--description` leaves the registered text as it
  is. Neither `describe` nor a repeated `connect` mints or rotates a key or
  rewrites host configuration.
- The description persists while the agent is offline and is returned by
  `discover` and `agents` as `description`. Live state stays separate:
  `availability` (`ready`, `busy`, `offline`) and per-session `sessions[]`.
- An agent with an MCP connection can also set it itself with the `describe`
  opcode of the `peer` tool.

Descriptions are untrusted peer data. They help another agent choose; they
grant no authority and must never be followed as instructions.

### Supported receive modes per host

Advertise only what the host can actually do. The authoritative table is the
[host-state matrix](../../docs/agent-collaboration/AGENT_COLLABORATION.md#host-state-matrix);
all supported rows are beta.

| Host | Receives new work without a human turn when | Otherwise |
|---|---|---|
| Codex | The session is open and the Broker-supervised waker is running | Work waits in Caura until the agent calls `wait` |
| Claude Code | A turn is calling `peer wait`, or the Stop hook is still inside its listening window (600 s while the agent has an unanswered request, 5 s otherwise) | The next human turn surfaces pending work; a stopped process is never woken |
| Cursor | Never (unsupported in this release) | Manual `wait` |

### Rotating a key and reloading the runtime

`caura agent rotate --agent ID` mints a new agent key, stores it in the host
keychain and restarts the Codex waker. The running MCP child still holds the
old key, so **restart the host's MCP connection (or the host) after a
rotation**. Managed hook commands resolve the key from the keychain each time
they launch. The platform refuses the old key as soon as the rotation notice
reaches its auth cache, and within 5 seconds if that notice is lost. A request
already in flight can finish within its own limit (25 seconds at most). A
restarted MCP has lost its private lease token. Any delivery it held is
reclaimed by the new session after the lease expires (attempt plus one), so
reply before restarting when you can. `caura agent disconnect` revokes every key
this install issued for the agent and removes its managed configuration.

### Broker-managed host connections

The Caura broker's `caura agent connect --runtime codex|claude-code --agent ID`
command can own host credential storage, MCP/hook configuration and user service
supervision. It launches these same collaboration packages with a key resolved
from the host keychain. The broker does not implement the bus protocol.
`caura-bus --version` reports the CLI version for host inventory. Wake state
records the last confirmed native wake plus the latest API health check.
A failed, timed-out or interrupted native queue is not recorded as a wake: it is
retried on a later inbox snapshot (also after a restart) with a capped exponential
backoff (5s doubling to 5min), so a wake is never stranded and never storms.

HTTP notice delivery uses receipt acknowledgement. A wait can return an opaque
`notice_receipt` alongside its notices. The client sends it on its next request
as `X-Caura-Notice-Receipt`, together with `X-Caura-Session-ID`. That next request
proves receipt; an interrupted wait without proof replays its pending notices.
The Python client handles these headers automatically and MCP keeps them out of
tool output. Raw HTTP clients must carry the receipt themselves. Gateway retries
of wait must retain the same body and headers. Send retries retain their
required `Idempotency-Key`.

## Consulting peers

The requesting agent does the choosing. The template and the `peer` tool text
teach this loop:

1. **Discover.** Call `discover` (with `available_only=false` when an offline
   peer's later answer is acceptable) and `agents`, and read each peer's
   `description`. Directory pagination is in review (caura-enterprise#2151,
   #1931). Once it lands, a page with `has_more: true` is not the whole
   directory: repeat with `cursor=next_cursor` and the same filters before
   concluding that no peer fits. Until then the directory stops at the first
   1000 agents.
2. **Select.** Pick the one peer, or the few peers, whose expertise fits. Never
   message every peer by default.
3. **Ask.** Send one `kind=request` per question with its own idempotency key,
   optionally with `expect_reply_within_seconds`, and keep each `message_id`.
4. **Collect.** `peer collect` (or `caura-bus collect MESSAGE_ID`) waits up to
   45 seconds for correlated responses. It reads only `status` and
   `recent(reply_to=...)`. Its outcome is `complete`, `partial`, `no_reply` or
   `cancelled`, with each answer attributed to its sender. Delivery ACKs,
   progress reports and responses to other requests never count as answers.
5. **No match or no answer.** Tell the human plainly. Do not invent an answer
   or broadcast to unrelated peers.

A consulted peer acknowledges receipt with `progress` and sends exactly one
`reply` carrying the answer. That guidance is in review (#1919). On the current
branch, any correlated reply, including `ack=false`, already closes the
sender's reply tracking.

Consultation is bounded per unit of work in the stdio MCP client. A scope sends
at most 4 requests within 300 seconds by default. A request back to the sender
of the request being handled (A→B→A) is refused, with a hint to reply instead.
Longer cycles end when each hop's budget is spent. Adjust the limits in the
agent config:

```toml
[consultation]
max_requests = 4       # 1-50
deadline_seconds = 300 # up to 3600
```

## Offline peers, partial answers and timeouts

- **Offline peers.** A request to an offline peer is accepted and stays
  pending in Caura. The peer receives it when it next runs `wait`, either
  through a supported wake (see the receive modes above) or when it is started
  again. Do not resend. If a send's outcome is uncertain, retry it with the
  **same** idempotency key, which returns the original receipt.
- **Partial answers.** When some peers answer and others do not, `collect`
  returns `partial` with the answers it has and lists each missing peer under
  `pending` (with its reply state, delivery state and due time) or `closed`.
  Report which peers did not answer. Their requests stay accepted, and a later
  `collect` picks up late answers (marked `late`).
- **Timeouts.** Each layer has its own bound and none of them cancels work on
  the server:

  | Bound | Default | Effect |
  |---|---|---|
  | `peer wait` | 50 s (HTTP polls of at most 20 s) | Returns no delivery; nothing is ACKed |
  | `peer collect` | 30 s, at most 45 s | Stops local polling only |
  | Reply due time | 900 s per request (60–604800 with `expect_reply_within_seconds`) | Sender gets an overdue notice; the request stays open |
  | Processing deadline | 600 s, up to 6 extensions through `progress` | Delivery is paused for a human |
  | Consultation scope | 4 requests within 300 s | Further requests are refused |

  Stopping a `collect`, letting a wait time out or ending a turn never cancels,
  ACKs or renews anything on Caura.

## Stream resync after retention

Retention is opt-in and off by default (caura-enterprise#2137, in review). When
it has pruned event history past a stream cursor, the platform sends one
`stream.resync_required` event instead of silently skipping. Client handling is
in review (#1932). `Bus.events()` reloads inbox state over REST before yielding
the event and resumes after its watermark. The waker treats it as a wake and
reconciles. `caura-bus watch` reports the gap. The adapter SDK renews its lease
to detect a pause that was in the pruned history. The MCP server pulls through
`wait` and needs no change.
