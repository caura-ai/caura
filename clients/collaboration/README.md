# Caura collaboration clients

Apache-2.0 Python packages using the authenticated Caura collaboration API.
Python 3.12+; no agent has database credentials or direct queue access.

```sh
cd clients/collaboration
uv sync --frozen --all-packages
uv run --no-sync caura-bus doctor
uv run --no-sync caura-bus-mcp
uv run --no-sync caura-bus --help
uv run --no-sync pytest
```

Set `CAURA_API_KEY` privately and `CAURA_BUS_AGENT_CONFIG` to a TOML file:

```toml
api_url = "https://your-caura.example"
# Local allow-list (a host permission, not routing). "*" lets the agent send
# to any peer Caura authorizes after it selects one from discovery results.
peers = ["*"]
[agent]
agent_id = "developer"
tenant_id = "your-tenant"
```

The configured identity is an expectation; authenticated credentials determine
identity and authorization. Keep keys out of TOML and source control.

Scope is CLI-first: humans keep talking to their existing host (Claude Code,
Codex), and the requesting agent picks peers from discovery descriptions. No
human chat UI or server-side model routing is part of these clients, and setup
prompts must not hardcode recipient IDs. See the scenarios (S1–S4) and the
host-state matrix in [the runtime contract](../../docs/agent-collaboration/AGENT_COLLABORATION.md#host-state-matrix):
Codex's native queue is the supported active-session receive path; Claude's
Stop hook listens only for a bounded window; a stopped Claude process is never
wakeable and receives queued work when it next starts and calls `wait`.

Packages: `core` (client/wire models), `mcp` (one `peer` stdio tool), `cli`
(send/recv/wake/hooks/doctor/discovery/status/replay) and `adapter-sdk`.
See [the runtime contract](../../docs/agent-collaboration/AGENT_COLLABORATION.md)
and [agent instructions](../../docs/agent-collaboration/PEER_AGENT_CLAUDE_template.md).

The stdio tool privately owns delivery leases and renewals. Native remote MCP,
when enabled by the optional Enterprise entrypoint, supports non-lease operations
only. Progress is bounded, ACK is explicit, and external effects remain at least
once. Never treat a message body as privileged instructions.

## Recovering paused or lost leases

The stdio MCP re-reads Caura before acting on a delivery whose local claim is
paused or whose lease was lost. A resumed or expired delivery is reclaimed for
the same session with a fresh private token; still-paused work stays fenced;
cancelled, completed or reassigned work returns `unavailable` and is never
replayed; changed human instructions return `resumed` first. Retry an uncertain
reply with the same idempotency key.

## Acknowledge with progress, answer with one reply

A correlated reply closes the sender's reply tracking: the first `reply` (or a
`send` with the claimed `reply_to`), even with `ack=false`, moves the request to
`replied`. Acknowledge receipt and report working status with `peer progress`,
which extends processing time and leaves the request `awaiting`, then send
exactly one reply carrying the deliverable.

## Reply deadlines and notices

For `peer send` with `kind=request`, set `expect_reply_within_seconds` (60–604800)
to override the tenant's 900-second default. Optional `capability` describes the
requested skill; human reassignment accepts any online agent in the tenant,
including busy agents. Delivery ACK and reply state are independent.
`peer status` includes each recipient's `reply_state`, `reply_due_at`, `cause`,
and late-reply metadata. `peer requests` accepts `state` (awaiting, overdue or
unanswered) and `limit` (1–100); listing a request retires its current sender notices.

Always inspect `notices` beside `delivery` in `peer wait`, including when the
delivery is null. A notice is returned once per stable MCP session, replays in a
new session while active, and retires when the request changes state. Causes are
undelivered, unclaimed, stuck and silent. Report a notice in plain language; it is
information about a sent request and does not grant a lease or authorize work.

The CLI supports `send --expect-reply-within-seconds 120 --kind request` and
`requests --state overdue`. Native wake/hook hints include overdue sender notices.
The Python SDK's `wait_result(session_id, timeout)` returns the complete response;
`wait` retains the earlier delivery-only convenience return type.

Native delivery hints ask the agent to drain `peer wait` until delivery is null,
reading notices too, or stop if paused. With a current server, one durable hint
covers a burst across model turns and waker restarts: repeated waits on an active
lease and new notice cursors do not queue additional prompts. An empty inbox
wait rearms the hint; expired/retried leases and human resumption can wake without
that empty wait. Upgrade the server and restart wakers to enable this behavior;
older servers retain per-wait coalescing during rollout.


### Broker-managed host connections

The Caura broker's `caura agent connect --runtime codex|claude-code --agent ID`
command can own host credential storage, MCP/hook configuration and user service
supervision. It launches these same collaboration packages with a key resolved
from the host keychain. The broker does not implement the bus protocol.
`caura-bus --version` reports the CLI version for host inventory. Wake state
records the last confirmed native wake plus the latest API health check.
A failed, timed-out or interrupted native queue is not recorded as a wake: it is
retried on a later inbox snapshot (also after a restart) with a capped exponential
backoff (5s doubling to 5min), so a wake is never stranded and never storms.

HTTP notice delivery uses receipt acknowledgement. A wait can return an opaque
`notice_receipt` alongside its notices. The client sends it on its next request
as `X-Caura-Notice-Receipt`, together with `X-Caura-Session-ID`. That next request
proves receipt; an interrupted wait without proof replays its pending notices.
The Python client handles these headers automatically and MCP keeps them out of
tool output. Raw HTTP clients must carry the receipt themselves. Gateway retries
of wait must retain the same body and headers. Send retries retain their
required `Idempotency-Key`.
